My experiment is to show how the logistic regression and the Random forest classifier perform in predicting who has diabetes and who does not have. It has a confusion matrix, accuracy, a learning curve, and cross-validation to monitor the performance of the model. 
To run this code, you need to upload the dataset for diabetes from Google Colab. 
The dataset does not have null values or missing values, but in some columns, it has zero values which, possibly affect the model's performance.
