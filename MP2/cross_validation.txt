The summary of 5-fold cross-validation results is that the logistic regression has an accuracy of 0.7538 and a standard deviation of 0.0437, while the random forest classifier has an accuracy of 0.7604 and a standard deviation of 0.0497. The random forest classifier had a slightly higher average accuracy across the 5 folds, but also a slightly larger standard deviation, indicating that it has slightly better performance than the logistic regression model.
